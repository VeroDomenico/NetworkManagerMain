The goal of this is repo is to create a network managment system for handling friendships, and networks that are carreer oriented



Components
* Some way of storing information and routine checks
* Some way of sending SMS, IMessages to those.

A good first concept would be creating a database that stores the information of people I have met like a contact book along with other characteristics.
This will also allow for automation of sending messages. 


Proposed languages
c++, golang, python, swift? 

Swift For IOS on Apple

We could also use phone link on windows pc but ideally we are communicating with a server that manages all of this information.

use docker?

Failures: 
Usage of google model as a alt to chat-gpt API failed. 2) Google Model Failure too little parameters for meaningful generation

Tasks:
1) Mongodb Driver setup to connect to database
2) use chat gtp API to generate messages. 
3) Work on Authentication and Authorization
4) Revist directives and see I want it to crawl linked in and message potenial people or notify me.
