The goal of this is repo is to create a network managment system for handling friendships, and networks that are carreer oriented



Components
* Some way of storing information and routine checks
* Some way of sending SMS, IMessages to those. 

Concept:
A good first concept would be creating a database that stores the information of people I have met like a contact book along with other characteristics. Then sends a happy birthday message on their birthday. 

Proposed languages
c++, golang, python, swift? 

Swift For IOS on Apple

We could also use phone link on windows pc but ideally we are communicating with a server that manages all of this information.
